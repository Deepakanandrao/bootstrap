## How it works

Offcanvas is a sidebar component that can be toggled via JavaScript to appear from the left, right, top, or bottom edge of the viewport.
Buttons or anchors are used as triggers that are attached

### Offcanvas components

<div class="bd-example-offcanvas p-0 bg-body-tertiary overflow-hidden"><div class="bd-example-snippet bd-code-snippet p-1">
  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-start show" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvas" aria-labelledby="offcanvasLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasLabel">Offcanvas</h5>
      <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      Content for the offcanvas goes here. You can place just about any Bootstrap component or custom elements here.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
